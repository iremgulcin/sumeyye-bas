# NewsVerifAI:Fake News Detection with Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

The initiative addresses the growing problem of false information spreading quickly on the internet due to unreliable sources. With an emphasis on the young to middle-aged active population, the goal is to develop an AI model for evaluating the accuracy of news articles. By enabling users to independently confirm the accuracy of news reports, the project tackles the negative effects of misinformation, including political division and cyberbullying. It offers a user-friendly fact-checking tool and closes the divide between technology and awareness, promoting a more critical and resilient society in the digital age.

Due to the extensive reach of online platforms, biased and inaccurate content has proliferated in recent years, impacting not only the internet but the entire information landscape. Unverified information can spread swiftly across a variety of internet channels, which has caused a number of social problems. The quick spread of unverified material is one such problem that has damaged the public's confidence in news media. The young and middle-aged are most impacted by this tendency, which has had a significant impact on public opinion and decision-making, as they are among the most frequent users of the internet. The project proposal acknowledges the need to address these issues and attempts to use artificial intelligence to enhance the functionality of existing models. The objective is to confirm the veracity of news articles on different websites so that people may make educated decisions about the information they come across in the wider digital world.

## Dataset

The main dataset for this project will come from Politifact, a nonprofit organization based in the United States that specializes in analyzing assertions made by prominent personalities on internet. A special "Truth-O-Meter" grading system, which goes from "True" to "Pants on Fire," is used by Politifact to assess the veracity and context of the claims. The varied Politifact dataset includes a range of ratings, including: TRUE, MOSTLY TRUE, HALF TRUE, MOSTLY FALSE, FALSE, PANTS ON FIRE.
